*** Chapter 4

1) Arithmetic Operator : Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
    ex : + , -  , * , /.
    
2) Assignment Operator : Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
    ex : int x = 10 ( = is assignment operator)'

*** Chapter 5 

1) labeled and unlabled statement.

	> break : is used to come out of the loop under certain condition. loop can be while loop or for loop etc.
	> continue : is opposite of break, this is used to skip the logic and start for the next sequence in under certain condition.
	
2) Exception : 	it is used to handle runtime error.we can use try, catch and throw for exception handling.
	 > try : The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
	 > catch : The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
	 > finally : The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
	 > throw : The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception
