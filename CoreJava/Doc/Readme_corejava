1) Arithmetic Operator : Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
    ex : + , -  , * , /.
    
2) Assignment Operator : Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
    ex : int x = 10 ( = is assignment operator)'
    
3) Relational Operator : Relational operators are used to  compare the values between two operands.
    ex : (> , < , <= , >= ,==).

4) Logical operator : Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values
    ex : AND , OR , NOT





*** Chapter 5 

1) What is loop : in programming language we use loop to run the block of code several times based on the condition
  				  in java we have while,do while and for loop.

1) labeled and unlabled statement.

	> break : is used to come out of the loop under certain condition. loop can be while loop or for loop etc.
	> continue : is opposite of break, this is used to skip the logic and start for the next sequence in under certain condition.
	
2) Exception : 	it is used to handle runtime error.we can use try, catch and throw for exception handling.
	 > try : The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
	 > catch : The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
	 > finally : The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
	 > throw : The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception 

*** Collection 

> In Java we use collection to store/read/update/delete object of similar type. There many collection in java refer the chart for that.
  Most popular collection we used are Array, List and Map	
  
  > there 2 type of "equal"  &7 "=="
  
  		- equal : this compare the value of content
  		- == : this compare the address of the object.
