1) Why Programming 

		Everyone uses computers, mobile phones and many other gadgets in day to day life to access various 
		applications. Different business domains like Education, Banking, E-Commerce, Healthcare, Insurance etc. 
		use computer applications. These applications are built using programming. 
		The knowledge of programming is essential to bring innovation. 
		You need to know how to code to create value with your ideas.
		
2)  Why do have so many programming language ?
    ANS We have so many programming languages because each programming language has 
        certain features and characteristics that make it suitable for specific tasks.
   
 > Keywords : Every programming language has a set of keywords which are reserved words having a predefined meaning.
     For Example. do,while,if,extend,abstract,static.
     
 > Variables : A variable is a named memory location which holds some value. The value stored in a variable can vary during the execution of the program.
 
 > Identifiers :  In Java, an identifier is the name given to a variable, method or class to uniquely identify it. 
          
               Rules for identifiers   
      
 > It can contain alphanumeric characters([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]), dollar sign ($), underscore (_).
 > It should not start with a digit ([0-9]). 
 > It should not have spaces. 
 > It should not be a Java keyword. 
 > It is case-sensitive. 
 > It has no length restrictions.
 
 ***** Operators 

 > Operators : Operators are the symbols used to perform specific operations. There are various operators that can be used for different purposes
     For Example : Arithmetic operation, Relational operation, Assignment operator, Logical operator.
     
 > Unary operator : Java unary operators are the types that need only one operand to perform any operation.
              like increment, decrement, negation, etc.
              
 > Arithmetic operator : Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.
              like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
              
 > Relational operator : Relational operators are used to compare two values. The result of all the relational operations is either true or false          
   
 ***** Selection Control Statement
 
 > If : In Java, the "if" statement is used to evaluate a condition. 
        The control of the program is diverted depending upon the specific condition.
        
 > If - else : The if-else statement is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e., else block. 
               The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false. 
               
 > If-else-If : The if-else-if statement contains the if-statement followed by multiple else-if statements.
 
 ***** Iterator Control Statement
 
 > For loop : Java for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. 
 > While loop : Java while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met.
 > Do while loop : The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly, until the specified condition is true.
